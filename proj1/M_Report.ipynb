    "<h2>Title: Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening</h2>\n",

    "<b>Problem</b><br>\n",
    "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that begins early in childhood and lasts throughout a person's life. It affects how a person acts, learns, interacts and communicate with others. As the research have shown that there is a significant increase in ASD (Autistic Spectrum Disorder) cases and often take significant amount of time in screening those cases. This leads to significant healthcare cost and delay in tackling these cases which very much brings down the success rate. Only early intervention of ASD brings out better success rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Solution</b><br>\n",
    "One solution could be by providing a predictive model based on the attributes would help in screening ASD and classifying it to ASD or non ASD cases. This would help patient and care givers to take intervening measures at the earliest.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Client</b><br>\n",
    "Client could be the health care provider/professional or could be parent/family who wants to screen their kids. Screening early would greatly reduce the healthcare cost and will have more success in handling ASD condition. Its proven that early intervention of Autism is the best treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Dataset</b>\n",
    "Data has been taken from Kaggle repository and contains 1054 records. There are 18 attributes and are of type categorical, binary and continuous. Data is collected based on the response of screening questions.\n",

    "A2\tHow easy is it for you to get eye contact with your child? <br>\n",
    "A3\tDoes your child point to indicate that s/he wants something? (e.g. a toy that is out of reach)<br>\n",
    "A4\tDoes your child point to share interest with you? (e.g. pointng at an interesting sight) <br>\n",
    "A5\tDoes your child pretend? (e.g. care for dolls, talk on a toy phone) <br>\n",
